This is the class for you. 
Painting bodies with woad is an art. Over more than twenty years I've woaded countless Celts and courts, battles and bards. I've decorated both grand ceremonies and the glorious everyday.
Let me help you expand your artistic toolbox and demystify the process.
In this class we'll talk about historical designs, particularly the art of the early Britons, looking for ideas and context. We'll talk a little bit about how to visually break down what we're seeing. Then we'll talk about some best practices for placing that artwork upon your subject.
By the end of the class, I hope you'll feel more prepared to face the daunting stare of the blank canvas, feel able to enjoy the alchemy of turning flat reference into 3D art, and—most of all—feel ready to decorate your community with beautiful, celebratory woad.

Additionally, with the expansion of the SCA's allowed regions, resources will be available to consider exploring non-Western personas (and navigate ways in which to do so gracefully). If you happen to have source books for your persona or others, please bring them!
Note: The first half of the class will broadly cover developing your persona, the second half will consist of working through and filling out your persona development worksheet.",2.0,"",,20,,,1,2022-03-01 14:58:06 UTC,Pennsic University

The play saw immense popularity during the seventeenth and early eighteenth century, and has seen renewed interest in the 21st century, particularly in the ways it speaks to English ideas about “exotic” climes and peoples.  
We’ll talk about the play’s treatment of “India” and the titular Island Princess, Armusia, as well as some historical and cultural contexts for shifting English ideas about English people and values in relation to the rest of the world.

Traditionally, it is the first step to learning the art of tea.
Learn the rudiments of being a guest at a *wabi*-style Japanese tea ritual. This introduction is especially intended for those wishing to participate in one of the *chakai* (tea gatherings) at Pennsic. Please wear comfortable clothing, bring a small fan if you have one, and please do not wear weapons or jewelry during tea rituals or tea practices.
If you are interested in purchasing materials for long-term personal use, then you should acquire a guest kit and a *fukusa*: 
A guest kit for men can be acquired at http://www.teadogu.com/guest-starter-kit-man339.html
A guest kit for women can be acquired at http://www.teadogu.com/guest-starter-kit-woman339.html
A *fukusa* for men can be acquired at http://www.teadogu.com/fumepunu9si.html
A *fukusa* for women can be acquired at http://www.teadogu.com/fuworenu9si.html
While it is possible to save money by ordering directly from Japan, doing so requires dealing with Japanese online storefronts. A note about *fukusa*. A number #9 *fukusa* is much easier to manipulate than *fukusa* with lower numbers. Paying extra is worth the price. A *fukusa* and a fan are what  you need to practice during class. I have an extremely limited number of loaner *fukusa*. You can substitute a number of items  for a fan. Please read the online descriptions of the fans carefully if you choose to provide a substitute or acquire a fan from another source.
There are a number of ways to acquire a 袱紗 *fukusa*. You can even try to make one, but please don't until you know what they are supposed to be like. There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp. (3) You can order one from a fellow in Portland http://www.teadogu.com/fukusa.html. (Yes, they really are that expensive.) I will try to pick up a couple of loaners (I currently have one) between now and Pennsic. Regardless, the fan is the symbol of the guest, and the *fukusa* is the symbol of the host in the world of tea.",1.0,This class will include a multi-page printed handout. ,1.0,20,,,1,2022-05-01 00:45:03 UTC,Pennsic University

Pirates are sacking the port town! The residents are defending their treasures. After 30 minutes or after retrieving 6 treasure chests, the pirates sail away. Eastern Army ship shall be named the Iron Sky. :)
Scenario Rules:
● This scenario consists of two 30-minute unlimited resurrection battles. One side will attack, while the other defends. After victory conditions are met **OR** 30 minutes have passed, there will be a 10-minute break and the armies will switch roles.
● The pirates must start on their Pirate Ship (inside the fort). Defenders must start at or behind the first row of chests (at least 60 feet from the attacker’s rez point).
● Unlimited resurrections. The Pirates must return to the gangplank of their ship to resurrect. Defenders must resurrect at the barracks.
● The pirates must retrieve the chests of treasure located within the town and bring them back to their ship.
○ There are 6 chests on the field as indicated on the map.
○ Defenders may not move the chests.
○ Pirates cannot run while carrying a chest.
○ Chests can only be lifted and carried with an open hand by 4 able-bodied pirates. If a fighter is carrying two weapons, they may gather them in their other hand, but if they do this, they may not fight while carrying the chest. If any person carrying a chest is killed, armed, or legged, the chest is set down and may only be picked up when there are 4 able-bodied pirates in position. (# of pirates to carry chest may be dropped at Beer and Brats.)
Scoring:
● A chest is scorable when it passes the threshold of the ship (delineated by the doors to the Fort). This is PAST the Pirates’ rez points.
● The Pirates can score up to one point per chest.
● It is possible for both armies to end with the same number of points.
General Rules:
● Death from behind and knee-walking are allowed.
● No rapier spears are allowed.
● **RUBBER BAND GUNS:**
○ Each pirate may carry one gun, and each gun is limited to one shot. In other words, each pirate is limited to one shot.
○ Sharing guns or carrying more than one piece of ammunition will be considered cheating and offenders will be removed from the field immediately.
○ May not be shot through walls.
○ Shots may be parried; if a weapon or parrying device is hit, the shot does not damage the weapon or device. (This is to prevent confusion or arguments on the field, as it can be very hard
to know if a rubber band gun ammo has hit something that is being carried.)

There are a number of ways to acquire a 袱紗 *fukusa*. You can even try to make one, but please don't until you know what they are supposed to be like. There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp. (3) You can order one from a fellow in Portland http://www.teadogu.com/fukusa.html.

• Between the left and center flags, there is a wall of double-stacked hay bales 30 ft long with a 30-degree bend towards the outer wall at the 10 ft and 20 ft points. Arrows/thrown weapons cannot
shoot over the wall, but ballistas can.
• Between the center and right flags, there is a pond with a bridge over it. The pond is an oval 50 ft long by 20 ft wide with a 10-ft wide bridge between the two flags. All missiles may shoot over the bridge and lake. Pond can be marked using rope and the bridge will be marked with haybales.
Scenario rules:
Scenario 1: 20 minute CA.
Combat Archery and Thrown Weapons allowed. No siege. Victory condition: Control the flags at 3 random time checks (marshal determined day of and kept confidential). Control is determined by color of the banner at time check. Contested banners will not count. Each banner will count individually. Winner is determined by control of 5 of 9 (or majority) total banner counts. Unlimited resurrection allowed.
Scenario 2: 20 minute Siege
Siege only. No combat archery or thrown weapons. Victory condition: Destroy the enemy siege engines. Siege crews are committed to their respective engines at start of battle. Engines may have extra crew but after lay-on, crew cannot join or transfer engines. Engines are destroyed when the crews are reduced to one person or hit with 3 siege rounds. If both armies have engines surviving at the end of battle, winner is determined by the team that has the higher percentage of engines still operational. Optional rule: We may implement an advancing forward line at 5-minute increments. To be determined by the marshals at the beginning of the scenario.
Scenario 3: 20 minute Combined
Victory condition: Last man standing. Winner is army to eliminate their opponent. If both armies still have fighters at the time limit, winner is side with more survivors.
Bonus Scenario:
At the direction of the CA/Siege marshals, a target will be set up and each archer/engine will be given 3 shots to test accuracy. This will not have bearing on the War Point but can be used for bragging rights until next year! Best score wins in each category: Siege Direct, Siege Indirect, CA Crossbow, CA Longbow.",2.5,"",,,,,1,2022-06-20 15:26:03 UTC,War Point

Passes: 15 head-to-head competitions.
Description: Competitors will throw at a target 8’ tall and 4’ wide (one target for each thrower) marked with 9 circles of various sizes painted at different heights on each of the targets.
 Distance will be minimum throwing distance for AE, (10’ for axe/knife and 20’ for spear).
 Each competition will consist of three “heats""; first with axe, second with dagger, and third tie-breaking heat with spear. In the first two heats, the competitor will be allowed up to 20 throws to hit each of the nine targets. Throwers will alternate throws. The first thrower to hit all nine targets (with equal throws) wins the heat. If neither thrower hits all nine targets after 20 throws, the thrower who hits (and sticks for the duration of the throw) more of the nine targets wins the heat. If both hit all nine targets in the same number of throws or hit the same number of targets after 20 throws, the competitor will have a sudden-death match (the first to hit when the other misses is the winner). Multiple hits on the same target count only as one target. If after two heats the competitors are tied, the competition will move to a tiebreaker with spear. The first thrower (with equal throws) to hit the centermost target wins.
Victory Condition: The side that wins the majority of the head-to-head competitions wins the point. Notes: Each competitor will have the same number of weapons on the range and must obey the retrieval rules on the range. Each side will be represented by a team captain. Team captains will be the first competitors.

Parents and Guardians, please note that you must remain with your child at the Fête.

Volunteers needed: Volunteers are always needed for the Fête! We have need of gentles who want to sponsor their own activity or help with activities that need additional people. Gentles are needed to set up, help clean up as well as to provide general help (i.e., signing in children, relief staff, etc.). We can never have too many people helping. We ask that volunteers be at The Great Hall at 9 am for set up; clean up should be done by 2 pm. Please consider giving your time to ensure the children have a magnificent time!

There are a number of ways to acquire a 袱紗 *fukusa*. You can even try to make one, but please don't until you know what they are supposed to be like. There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp. (3) You can order one from a fellow in Portland http://www.teadogu.com/fukusa.html.
