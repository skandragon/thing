This class focuses on the origins, biological mechanisms, means of transmission and long term impact on the affected populations. When early man lived in relatively isolated groups, contact between individuals was infrequent and short-lived diseases (for either the disease or the host) were not able to spread by direct contact or through intermediaries such as rats, mosquitoes, etc. As people began to live closer together in towns, later in cities, and when lack of sanitation became more of a threat to health, transmission of diseases became easier and more common. Resistant individuals lived and the less-resistant died, thus selectively increasing resistance in the population as a whole. The gradually declining death toll seen in recurrences of a particular plague was due to an increase in resistance within the population due to several factors. Modern medical investigations indicate that the same genetic makeup that allowed some people to survive or avoid bubonic plague are the same genetic makeup that allows some people be HIV positive and not develop AIDS.

This is a multi-part workshop for beginners.,"Learn the rudiments of *wabi*-style tea including both the role of the host and the role of the guest. This is a multi-part workshop for beginners. Please come to as many classes as possible. 

*Okeiko* means ""honorable practice"". This is a multi-part workshop intended for beginners who wish to learn how to participate in tea gatherings. Both the role of the guest and the role of the host will be introduced. You will learn something new in each workshop. We will begin with walking and bowing and progress to the rudiments of preparing and consuming a bowl of *matcha*. Limited materials will be available for student use during the workshop. 

If you are interested in purchasing materials for long-term personal use, then you should acquire a guest kit and a *fukusa*: 
A guest kit for men can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/guest-starter-kit-man339.html
A guest kit for women can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/guest-starter-kit-woman339.html
A *fukusa* for men can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/fumepunu9si.html
A *fukusa* for women can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/fuworenu9si.html
While it is possible to save money by ordering directly from Japan, doing so requires dealing with Japanese online storefronts. A note about *fukusa*. A number #9 *fukusa* is much easier to manipulate than *fukusa* with lower numbers. Paying extra is worth the price. A *fukusa* and a fan are what  you need to practice during class. I have an extremely limited number of loaner *fukusa*. You can substitute a number of items  for a fan. Please read the online descriptions of the fans carefully if you choose to provide a substitute or acquire a fan from another source.

There are a number of ways to acquire a 袱紗 *fukusa*. You can even try to make one, but please don't until you know what they are supposed to be like. There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp. (3) You can order one from a fellow in Portland http://www.teadogu.com/fukusa.html (Yes, they really are that expensive.) I will try to pick up a couple of loaners (I currently have one) between now and Pennsic.

Combat standards are a modified counted-blow scenario that employs rules for capturing opponents and ransoming of captured parties. Participants must be acceptable to the captains of the French and English forces. Armor must be a reasonable attempt at a complete 14th-century harness. Weapons are restricted to ones that closely resemble their medieval counterparts. Final say on weapons and appropriate harness will be at the sole discretion of the captains.
Requirements:  All participants must wear a 14th-century kit. Greaves are required and all are encouraged to wear chausses and braies. All weapons must closely resemble their medieval counterpart and are restricted to bastard swords, pole-arms of period design (axes, hammers, etc.), spears under 7 feet, daggers and single-handed swords. All participants should be prepared to pay a ransom that they feel is appropriate to their station in the event that they are “captured” during this deed of arms.

Imagine rugby, soccer, tag football and roller derby rolled into one, played by a group of ladies (boys might get hurt) with cabbages serving as the ball.
Ladies who wish to play are encouraged to assemble teams of 5-6 women ahead of time. There will be multiple teams (the Helgas and the Olgas). You do not, however, need to be on a pre-made team to take part; we will be making teams there as well. Cabbage kickoff shall commence as soon as sufficient players are available on the field.

Team Composition
1.	There shall be 2 ""ladies only"" teams of 5 or 6 players, including an optional goalkeeper. 
2.	Players must be 18 years or older. 
3.	One team shall be called Helgas, and one team shall be called Olgas. The two teams shall be identified by different colored armbands. 
4.	All players must wear a dress. Viking garb is encouraged. 
5.	Players are encouraged to wear do-rags, heavy shoes/boots.

Officiating/Team Support
1.	Gentleman may not play Helga Ball (they might get hurt), but may serve as Officials or Team Support (chocolate bearers, refreshment staff, towel bearers, etc.).
2.	There shall be one Referee authorized to make decisions related to scoring and rules of the game. 
3.	Rules may be changed or added at any time if approved by the Referee. 
4.	All play shall stop when the Referee calls ""HOLD"". 
5.	The Referee may banish a player to a penalty box for any reason, and for any length of time.

Field Setup

1.	Field is square, 25 yards by 25 yards. 
2.	Two goals are located on the end line at opposite sides of field.
4.	Goal posts are hay bales, and will be positioned 3 yards apart. 
5.	The 4 corners of the field, the end lines where goals are positioned, and a center line must be marked for play.

Cabbages

1.	Up to three heads of cabbage may be used per game. 
2.	Cabbage should be compact and aged (sitting in a frost free fridge for a couple of weeks helps). 
3.	If a cabbage breaks up, play shall continue with the biggest remaining hunk unless/until the Referee calls hold and restarts play with a replacement cabbage.

Objective of the Game/Scoring Points

1.	Points are scored by getting a cabbage through/past your opponent's goalposts. Each score equals one point.
2.	Goalposts shall signal a ""score"" by raising one arm and yelling either ""Helga Ball!!"" or ""Olga ball!!"" to identify the scoring team. When goalposts disagree about a score, the Referee shall decide.
3.	Play shall continue until 10 minutes have elapsed (omitting HOLDS),  3 cabbages have been used, or 5 points scored by a team, whichever is first.
4.	The team with the most points at the end of play wins the game.

Rules of Play
1.	The game shall be started with kickoff at center line. 
2.	Kickoff at the center line shall follow each goal scored. 
3.	If the cabbage goes out of bounds, or, when directed by the Referee, play will be restarted by rolling the cabbage into play from a sideline. 
4.	Players may kick or dribble the cabbage with their feet, but may not touch the cabbage with their hands or use hands to pick up the cabbage. 
5.	Players may scoop the cabbage up in a skirt, or apron, and move the cabbage on the field. 
6.	Tackling is not allowed, but ""hugs"" (individual and group) are allowed.

Extra Rules and Notes

1) You must be 18 years or older to participate. (Age 16/17 with parental permission and parental attendance.)
2) Women and those that identify as such only. (Sorry, guys, but you can be goal posts!)
3) You must wear closed-toe shoes that you can run in. 
                   a) Steel-toe boots are not allowed. 
                   b) No cleats.
4) Soft knee pads and elbow pads and a mouth guard are **strongly** suggested.
5) You must wear a dress (Norse garb strongly encouraged), and an apron (of your choosing) over your dress to catch the cabbage.
6) There will be armbands for each team provided; you must wear this band when on the field in play.
7) There is no fee. However, we ask for a donation of feminine hygiene products or childcare product (diapers, bottles, wipes) for Paladin's Pantry.
8) **HAVE FUN!**

Spectators are welcome, and gentleman volunteers are always needed as goal posts and Team Support (chocolate bearers, refreshment staff, towel bearers, etc.).

Please come to as many classes as possible. 

*Okeiko* means ""honorable practice"". This is a multi-part workshop intended for beginners who wish to learn how to participate in tea gatherings. Both the role of the guest and the role of the host will be introduced. You will learn something new in each workshop. We will begin with walking and bowing and progress to the rudiments of preparing and consuming a bowl of *matcha*. Limited materials will be available for student use during the workshop. 

If you are interested in purchasing materials for long-term personal use, then you should acquire a guest kit and a *fukusa*: 
A guest kit for men can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/guest-starter-kit-man339.html
A guest kit for women can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/guest-starter-kit-woman339.html
A *fukusa* for men can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/fumepunu9si.html
A *fukusa* for women can be acquired at: http://www.teadogu.com/fuworenu9si.html
While it is possible to save money by ordering directly from Japan, doing so requires dealing with Japanese online storefronts. A note about *fukusa*. A number #9 *fukusa* is much easier to manipulate than *fukusa* with lower numbers. Paying extra is worth the price. A *fukusa* and a fan are what  you need to practice during class. I have an extremely limited number of loaner *fukusa*. You can substitute a number of items  for a fan. Please read the online descriptions of the fans carefully if you choose to provide a substitute or acquire a fan from another source.

There are a number of ways to acquire a 袱紗 *fukusa*. You can even try to make one, but please don't until you know what they are supposed to be like. There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp. (3) You can order one from a fellow in Portland http://www.teadogu.com/fukusa.html (Yes, they really are that expensive.) I will try to pick up a couple of loaners (I currently have one) between now and Pennsic.

Capture banners. 90 minutes. One pass.,"Format: Woods Battle, unlimited resurrection, no siege, combat archery, or thrown weapons.
Passes:  One.  
Time Limit: 90 minutes with a banner count at 30, 60, and 90 minutes +/- 4 minutes (at each check). The exact variant of time check is generated by the marshals prior to the start of the battle and is not revealed to combatants. Medical holds are general holds and stop the clock. Only medical holds can stop the clock. All holds, except medical, are assumed to be local and do not stop the clock.
Description: There will be four banners located in the woods: three fixed banners located in a stagger along a line equidistant from the Eastern and Middle resurrection points with one banner 300 ft closer to the Middle and one 300 ft closer to the East, one banner dead center and one mobile banner (in the same location as the center banner).  
The mobile banner will start the battle in the absolute center of the woods. After it is captured it may be moved. There will be a zone delineated as a band across the center of the woods 300 ft feet wide equidistant from each sides’ resurrection points. The mobile banner must stay within this zone.
All banners must be upright, visible, and displayed at all times.
Victory conditions:  At the banner count, each fixed banner controlled (control indicated by that army’s color being held up) is worth one check point. Having the mobile banner in your own scoring zone is worth two check points. If the mobile banner is not in a scoring zone, it is worth no points. If a banner color is not upright, it is not scored
Notes: Only a gauntleted hand may hold a banner. The mobile banner must be carried above the waist and be clearly displayed. The banner bearer is engaged 360 degrees while carrying the mobile banner. The blow force to kill/injure the banner bearer without traditional engagement shall be judged as a positive force blow significantly lighter than a normal blow. If the banner bearer is killed, the banner must be dropped by the dead banner bearer. Anyone with a gauntleted hand may pick up and move the dropped banner. Each banner will be marshaled by two marshals, one from the East and one from the Middle. (Picture below is a representation of intent.

Capture the banner. 60 minutes. Reset at 30 minutes.,"Format: Woods Battle, unlimited resurrection, resurrection occurs when a combatant returns to its resurrection line.
Passes: One pass consisting of two halves.
Time Limit: 60 minutes total with a banner count at 15⁺⁄₋4 & 30⁺⁄₋4 minutes of each half. The exact variant of time check is generated by the marshals prior to the start of the battle and is not revealed to combatants. Medical holds are general holds and stop the clock. Only medical holds can stop the clock. All holds, except medical, are assumed to be local and do not stop the clock.
At 30 minutes there will be a 10-minute break where all banners and chests will be reset to their starting positions and all combatants must return to their start/resurrection line
Description: The field will be laid out with a Southern and Northern start/resurrection line running East to West. Halfway between and equidistant to the start/res lines will be the banner line. On the banner line, there will be three banners: one in the dead center of the banner line, one banner to the East and one to the West equidistant to the central banner but not within sight of it.  All banners are static.  The banners will be marked on either end with Red and Blue. To be counted, a banner must be held with one color aloft.  All held banners must be upright, visible, and displayed at all times.
There will be two chests in the Woods each placed by the principal King and marked according to their side (red/blue).  The kings may place their chests within the chest-starting zone on their end of the field as defined by the battlefield map. These chests may be captured and moved. The chests must be carried by two people in order to be moved. A chest may not be moved closer than 75’ to its own start/res line. The people carrying the chest must move in a manner safe for conditions and must be mindful of running engagement rules. If engaged, they may not run through the engagement.
At the start and second half of the battle all combatants must be at their start/res line. Each principal King (or designated champion) must start the battle at their chest and must be in contact with the chest.
Victory Conditions: At each time check, control of the banners and chests will be counted and will be scored as follows: Control of a banner is worth 1 check point, having your chest in its starting point is worth one check point, and having your opponent’s chest at your chest limit line is worth 1 check point.

Details at https://www.facebook.com/groups/1928749080691736/,"This tourney is part of an ongoing celebration of the 800th anniversary of The Marshall’s death in 2019. Fought in the style of the 12th-century ransom tourneys of France, teams of fighters in armor, appropriate from 1000-1250 AD, will fight to gain ransom and glory. Detailed rules will be posted at https://www.facebook.com/groups/1928749080691736/ 

All SCA authorization, armor and weapons standards apply to the tournament.
All combatants must conform to the weapon and armor standards of the tournament. 
The tournament will consist of five rounds of melée, 15 minutes each, with a 5-minute break between to hydrate or settle ransoms. 
Dress:
1) No visible plastic including, but not limited to, baskets hilts. 
2) No visible sneakers or modern footwear (i.e., Crocs).
3) Armor should be from 1000-1250. Surcoats highly recommended.
4) European & Middle Eastern armor only. No Japanese, Chinese, etc.
Weapon restrictions: 
1) No flamboyant duct tape (i.e., Hello Kitty duct tape).
2) Pole arms must be six feet or under, and must have a head or a proper profile (subject to approval), i.e., no unpadded pole arms.
3) Shields must be painted, heraldry recommended. (Don't take this as a personal challenge; this is also subject to approval.) 
4) Spears, daggers, axes, maces and greatswords are welcome. No madus permitted.
5) Basket-hilted swords are prohibited. 
Combat and Ransom:
All normal SCA combat rules apply. Example: telling blow to limbs loss of the limb. Blows to the arm or leg wound. Sufficient blows to the head/body mean a fighter has been bested. (See Ransoming)
TEAMS: To be chosen at the beginning of the tournament. We will attempt to make the sides even and fair, as well as attempt to keep whole units together. Changing of sides is permitted.

RANSOMING: (Rules subject to change; please check https://www.facebook.com/groups/1928749080691736/ for updates!) 
To be bested means to be struck with a sufficient blow to the body or head. (You can also choose to receive any blow as a blow that bests you.) Closed face helmet ignore face thrusts/dying. A thrust to an open-faced helm kills, and the fighter can not be ransomed.
Once bested, combatant takes a knee and counts to a predetermined amount of time, (this does not have to be out loud), and:
1) is escorted by opposing team to the Resurrection point for ransom. 
Or:
2) Time runs out and they return to their own resurrection point to resurrect.
3) Rescue: You make rescue a teammate by engagement and driving off a captor or besting or killing them. The captured fighter must remain out of the fight until the rescue is complete, then must resurrect. 

How the Ransom works:
There will be two people on either side to record the ransoms. Suggested ransom is an item between $5 - $25 in value and should be fitting of one's station. The terms must be agreed upon by both parties. 
Eleanor of Aquitaine Clause: A member of the gallery can provide ransom and is encouraged to do so, especially if they deem the combatant worthy. Ladies providing a favor maybe used in place of a ransom, or demanded as a ransom. ",3.0,"",,,,,1,2019-04-22 10:35:09 UTC,Battlefield

This class focuses on the origins, biological mechanisms, means of transmission and long term impact on the affected populations. When early man lived in relatively isolated groups, contact between individuals was infrequent and short-lived diseases (for either the disease or the host) were not able to spread by direct contact or through intermediaries such as rats, mosquitoes, etc. As people began to live closer together in towns, later in cities, and when lack of sanitation became more of a threat to health, transmission of diseases became easier and more common. Resistant individuals lived and the less-resistant died, thus selectively increasing resistance in the population as a whole. The gradually declining death toll seen in recurrences of a particular plague was due to an increase in resistance within the population due to several factors. Modern medical investigations indicate that the same genetic makeup that allowed some people to survive or avoid bubonic plague are the same genetic makeup that allows some people be HIV positive and not develop AIDS.

The Fête is from 10 am to 1 pm on Wednesday of War Week, A.S. LIV (modernly known as August 7, 2019) in the Great Hall. This event is designed for children ages four and older.

The event will be filled with a variety of arts and crafts, ongoing activities and live performances to amuse and delight. We may have some activities that involve water, so please make sure your young ones are dressed appropriately. Please have socks if you wish to play in the Bounce Castle! There will be a light snack and drinks available for children and their parents.

Parents / Guardians, you must remain with your child at the Fête. Due to the large number of children attending, organizers cannot be responsible for food allergies or other health issues. We ask that children do not bring personal items as the organizers will not be responsible for lost, broken or stolen items and sad faces.

Volunteers Needed:
Volunteers are always needed for the Fête! We have need of gentles who want to sponsor their own activity or help with activities that need additional people. Gentles are needed to set up, help clean up and to provide general help (i.e., signing in children, relief staff, etc.). We can never have too many people helping. We ask that volunteers be at The Great Hall at 9 am for set up, and clean up should be done by 2 pm. Volunteers who will be registering children, please come to the Great Hall around 8:30 for training! Please consider giving your time to ensure the children have a magnificent time! Without the generous volunteers who give of their time and energy each year, the party would not happen. We request that you wear something pink to honor the Fête’s founder, Duchess Arielle of Atlantia.

Shields cannot be stacked on top of each other to form an impenetrable wall.
Pavises may be moved, but must be placed prior to use.
Engines are destroyed by taking 3 siege rounds or being reduced to lower than required crew members.
The field will be 200 ft (east/west) by 150 ft. (north/south)
Siege engines will be restricted to a 50 ft-wide area inside the east and west sides of the field. This will be considered a “no person’s land” except for engine crews.
Across the middle of the field will be 3 flags placed at 25 ft, 75 ft, and 125 ft.
Between the left and middle flags there is a wall of double-stacked hay bales 30 ft long with a 30 degree bend towards the outer wall at the 10 ft and 20 ft points. Arrows/thrown weapons cannot shoot over the wall, but ballistas can.

Scenario rules:
Scenario 1: 
Combat archery and thrown weapons allowed. No siege. Victory condition: Control the flags at 3 random time checks (marshal-determined day of and kept confidential).

Scenario 2: 
Siege only. No combat archery or thrown weapons. Victory condition: Destroy the enemy siege engines. Siege crews are committed to their respective engines at start of battle. Engines may have extra crew but after lay-on, crew cannot join or transfer engines. Engines are destroyed when the crews are reduced to one person or hit with 3 siege rounds. If both armies have engines surviving at the end of battle, winner is determined by the team that has the most engines still operational. 20-minute battle. Optional rule: We may implement an advancing forward line at 5-minute increments. To be determined by the marshals at the beginning of the scenario. 
Scenario 3: 
Victory condition: Last man standing. Winner is army to eliminate their opponent. If both armies still have fighters at the time limit, winner is side with more survivors. 20-minute battle.  
Bonus Scenario: 
At the direction of the CA/Siege marshals, a target will be set up and each archer/engine will be given 3 shots to test accuracy.

Description: Competition consists of several challenging targets utilizing axe, knife, and spear.
","Format: 15 vs 15 teams made up from the East, Middle, and Allies.
Passes: 15 head-to-head competitions.
Description: Competitors will throw at a target 8’ tall and 4’ wide (one target for each thrower) marked with 9 circles of various sizes painted at different heights on each of the targets. Each competition will consist of three “heats’: first with axe, second with dagger, and third tie-breaking heat with spear. In the first two heats, the competitor will be allowed up to 20 throws to hit each of the nine targets. Throwers will alternate throws. The first thrower to hit all nine targets (with equal throws) wins the heat. If neither thrower hits all nine targets after 20 throws, the thrower who hit more of the nine targets wins the heat. If both hit all nine targets in the same number of throws or hit the same number of targets after 20 throws, the competitor will have a sudden death match. (The first to hit when the other misses is the winner.) Multiple hits on the same target count only as one target. If after two heats the competitors are tied, the competition will move to a tiebreaker with spear. The first thrower (with equal throws) to hit the centermost target wins.
Victory Condition: The side that wins the majority of the head-to-head competitions wins the point.
Notes: Each competitor will have the same number of weapons on the range and must obey the retrieval rules on the range. Each side will be represented by a team captain. Team captains will be the first competitors. After the first competition, the sides will alternate choosing a thrower first with the loser of the first competition choosing first in the second.

Each side attacks and defends with armored and rapier separately. Times will be added together. Shortest combined time wins.,"Format: This will be a timed battle. Each side will attack and defend both with armored and rapier. The times for the armored attack and rapier attack will be added together. The side with the shortest combined attack time wins.
Passes: One pass with each armored and rapier on the attack, one on the defense.
Time Limit: None.
Note: Attackers have unlimited resurrection. Defenders get two resurrections (three lives total).
Description: The attackers must make their way through the mountain via one of four paths to capture all the banners to stop the clock. A banner is captured when it is grasped by an empty gauntleted (armored) or open (rapier) hand.
The mountain is 150’ long along the paths available. There are four paths:
The Goat’s Path: This path is no less than 3’ wide and no more than 6’ wide. It is a crooked and random path. (ARMORED) Combat archery and thrown weapons are allowed to fire on, to, and from this path but siege may not fire to or from this path. This means archers on this path may fire at the Hot Gate and vice-versa. (RAPIER) Rubber band guns are allowed to fire on this path. They may not be fired off the end of the mountain or onto the mountain from off the end of the path. (You and your target must both be on the Goat Path.)
The Hot Gate: This path starts at 54’ wide on the attackers end and narrows progressively to 36’ wide at the defenders end. (ARMORED) Siege, Combat archery and thrown weapons are allowed. Combat archers may fire at the Goat Path and vice-versa. Attacker’s siege must start 50’ from the end of the path. Once the banner nearest the attacker’s end is captured, siege may advance to the end of the path. Defenders' siege may begin at the end of the path. Once the banner near the defenders' end is captured, siege must retreat to 50’ from the end of the path. All normal siege firing rules apply. (RAPIER) Rubber band guns are not allowed.
The Mine: This is a straight path 45’ wide. No missiles (neither in armored or rapier) are allowed and only weapons 6’ and under may be used due to the low ceiling.
The Catacombs: This is a meandering path between 9 and 12 feet wide. No missiles are allowed (neither in armored or rapier) and only weapons 6’ and under may be used due to the low ceiling. Throughout the catacomb are tombs roughly 6 ft long and 4 ft wide, (2 bales long, 2 bales wide, 2 hay bales high). Blows may be thrown over the tombs, but you may not climb over them.
Layout: Banners will serve as resurrection points. The attacker’s resurrection points will be located 36’ from their end of the mountain at locations halfway between the Goat Path and the Hot Gate, halfway between the Hot Gate and the Mine, and halfway between the Mine and the Catacombs. The defenders will have the same set up on their side of the mountain. Additionally, there will be banners/resurrection points 50’ from each end of the Hot Gates and the Mine. 
Before the beginning cannon of the battle, the defenders may place their defensive positions on the mountains how they choose.  The defenders may not leave the mountain to the attackers' side at any time. The defenders may use the banner/res points on the mountain as long as they control them. If/when the attacker captures and flips a banner that becomes a resurrection point for the attackers. Once a banner has been captured/flipped, it cannot be recaptured. The clock stops once the attackers has captured all four banners on the mountain and the three banners on the defenders' side of the mountain.

Rubber Band Gun Rules:
Two guns per person maximum, five shots per gun maximum.
NO AMMO GLEANING.
All RBGs must be handheld. No cannons are permitted.
Rigid and soft parry devices, swords, and daggers are impervious to RBG shot. Shot that lands on a combatant has the same effect as a thrust from a blade.
After the guns have no more shot, they may still be used as rigid parries or be switched out at the resurrection point.
Friendly fire is still lethal.",2.0,"",,,,,1,2019-04-14 23:10:12 UTC,War Point

Wrapping Up: What can we improve? What’s missing? What classes do we want to see taught that aren’t? What topics do we want to discuss? How can we make the bardic arts and its class tracks even better?",2.0,"",,,,,1,2019-06-06 20:19:02 UTC,Pennsic University
