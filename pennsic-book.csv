We will begin with walking and bowing and progress to the rudiments of preparing and consuming a bowl of *matcha*. Limited materials will be available for student use during the workshop. 
If you are interested in purchasing materials for long-term personal use, then you should acquire a guest kit and a *fukusa*: 
A guest kit for men can be acquired at http://www.teadogu.com/guest-starter-kit-man339.html

A *fukusa* for women can be acquired at http://www.teadogu.com/fuworenu9si.html
While it is possible to save money by ordering directly from Japan, doing so requires dealing with Japanese online storefronts. A note about *fukusa*. A number #9 *fukusa* is much easier to manipulate than *fukusa* with lower numbers. Paying extra is worth the price. A *fukusa* and a fan are what  you need to practice during class. I have an extremely limited number of loaner *fukusa*. You can substitute a number of items  for a fan. Please read the online descriptions of the fans carefully if you choose to provide a substitute or acquire a fan from another source.
There are a number of ways to acquire a 袱紗 *fukusa*. You can even try to make one, but please don't until you know what they are supposed to be like. There is some controversy over just how old they are. Today, men use slightly larger *fukusa* than women do. Further, men always use purple *fukusa* and women typically only use purple *fukusa* after they have become senior instructors. Regardless, here are purchase options. (1) You can always try ebay. (2) You can order online from any of several tea supply stores in Japan through rakuten.co.jp. (3) You can order one from a fellow in Portland http://www.teadogu.com/fukusa.html. (Yes, they really are that expensive.) I will try to pick up a couple of loaners (I currently have one) between now and Pennsic.

New interpretations of the dances suggest monastic origins. Lecture-style class.,"The *Gresley Dance Manuscript* was written circa 1490, antedating previously discovered written records of English dance. Little is known about the *Gresley Dance Manuscript* and the text has gone largely unexamined by historians. My study of the manuscript begins by considering the dances themselves through reconstruction of the dance choreographies recorded in the manuscript. I argue that the dances recorded in the *Gresley Dance Manuscript* are an early example of English dance choreographies which appear to share similarities with European dance forms, similarities which are not identifiable in later English dance choreographies. The Gresley dances share with European dance forms the choreographic elements associated with courtship in continental dance styles. I assert that the Gresley dances may have been recorded in the Gresley Priory, suggesting the presence of complex dance forms which feature choreographic markers of courtship in a monastic setting. This course will be taught in a lecture style and will focus on the conclusion of my research.

King Afshin and Queen Jasmine, gracious Monarchs of Atlantia, extend an invitation to the children of the Knowne World to attend the 24th Annual Knowne World Children's Fête at Pennsic L.
The fête will take place in the Great Hall on Wednesday, August 9, from 10 am until 1 pm. This event is designed for children ages four and older.
In keeping with previous years, the morning will be filled with a variety of arts and crafts, ongoing activities, and live performances to amuse and delight. We may have some activities that involve water, so please make sure your young ones are dressed appropriately. There will be a light snack and drinks available for children and their parents.
Parents and Guardians, please note that you must remain with your child at the Fête. Due to the large numbers of children that attend, organizers cannot be responsible for food allergies or other health issues. We ask that children do not bring personal articles with them as the organizers will not be responsible for lost, broken or stolen items and sad faces.
Volunteers needed: volunteers are always needed for the Fête! We have need of gentles that want to sponsor their own activity or help with the activities that need additional people. Gentles are needed to set up and help clean up and also to provide general help (i.e., signing in children, relief staff, etc.). We can never have too many people helping. We ask that volunteers be at the Great Hall at 9 am for setup, and cleanup should be done by 2 pm. Please consider giving your time to ensure the children have a magnificent time! We request that you wear something pink to honor the Fête's founder, Duchess Arielle of Atlantia.
If you would like to help or need additional information, please contact Rebbah Thamira haSopheret at 336-three four one - 1660. This will surely be another fun-filled, festive occasion for the children of the Knowne World. Please remember that without the generous volunteers who give of their time and energy each year, the party would not happen.",3.0,"",,,,,1,2023-03-07 00:58:50 UTC,Event
