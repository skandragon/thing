    Pennsic University Merchant and Remuneration Policy
  .col-7.policy-body
    %p
      Pennsic University is not a money-making endeavor, neither are Pennsic
      University's "Thing" and other publications to be considered an advertising
      resource.
      Teachers should not expect to make money from Teaching classes.
      Pennsic Univeristy classes are not booked and tracked for tax compliance,
      or other such concerns generally under the aegis of the Merchants office.
    %p
      Pennsic Teachers shall not teach at Pennsic University classes (classes
      registered and Published in the "Thing") and be paid or given any
      compensation in exchange for doing so.
      This includes providing materials or other remuneration.
      Teachers may provide (at their cost) kits and materials for classes.
      They may provide loaner tools (and shared/loaner tools for hands on
      classes is strongly encouraged), or offer to provide tools and material
      through their merchant booth, but at no time should the teachers expect
      any students to pay to attend and reasonably participate in classes.
    %p
      Any materials or tools that must be purchased must be clearly published
      in the description for the class, and the fee/costs clearly stated
      in the "fees" section of the class registration.
      Provision of such purchased tools/materials that is accomplished at
      Pennsic itself must be done outside the University at a properly
      registered Merchant booth, and taxes properly collected on the
      transactions thereby.  There will be no exceptions.
    %p
      Failure to adhere to this policy will result in classes being
      cancelled, and the teacher prevented form teaching again, and
      reported to the Coopers for infraction of Merchant Rules.

    Pennsic University Tent Use Policy
  .col-7.policy-body
    %p
      Pennsic University tents may only be used for activities approved by the
      University Chancellor or other member of the Pennsic senior staff as
      designated by the Chancellor.
    %p
      Pennsic University tents may not be reserved for private, individual,
      or household parties at any time.
    %p
      Sleeping or camping is prohibited in Pennsic University tents, except
      in cases of extreme emergency (i.e., a severe storm or other natural disaster
      in which Pennsic staff have designated the University tents as a shelter point).
    %p
      Instructors should leave tents as clean as possible at the end of
      each class. Be courteous to the instructors and students
      following you and pick up after yourself.
    %p
      While most tents have power outlets, the total amount of electrical
      power available to the University is limited. To prevent blown fuses,
      electrical outlets in the tents should be used only for
      class-related activities (i.e., running a computer or projector for a
      lecture). Use of any equipment requiring significant power draw or
      running for longer than a normal class time (120 minutes, maximum)
      must be approved by the University Chancellor.

    Pennsic University Professional Standards of Practice Policy
  .col-7.policy-body
    %p
      No class can be offered that can be reasonably be construed
      as taking the place of licensed or otherwise certified caregivers
      or providers, whether it be as child care (in loco parentis), or
      as a source of mundane legal, medical or psychological advice.
      This policy is emplaced with the advice and consent of the Mayor's
      office and exists due to ongoing liability concerns.
    %p
      While the University strongly encourages study and research of
      Period medical practices, the line is drawn at anything that
      seems to be advocating, in our classes, any such practices, offered
      in any way, such that they may be reasonably considered as standing
      in lieu of mundane medical or legal advice.
      First-aid and other such classes offered by instructors shall have
      and be expected to show authoritative mundane certification to give
      such instruction.
    %p
      The University will not support or endorse any classes that may
      be reasonably considered to be practicing medicine or advocating
      the practice of medicine or giving medical treatment that is at
      variance with the mundane standards of medical care.
    %p
      If you are providing such classes as a period treatment of such
      practice within the historical context, then that is a great
      thing and we so strongly encourage such instruction.
    %p
      Such classes are required to preface the class session with
      a statement such as follows:
      .boxed-text
        "Pennsic University does not advocate the adoption of any diagnostic
        method or course of treatment not performed by properly licensed
        practitioners in accordance with the mundane medical (or legal)
        standard of care. This class will present medically (or legally)
        significant information for purely informational purposes only.
        The University strongly recommends that you always inform, and
        obtain advice from, mundane medical (or legal) professionals before
        altering or starting any course of diagnosis or treatment (or
        engaging in any legal practice) based on this class."

      Sterno&trade;
      cans, propane torches), you must obtain prior approval
      from the University Chancellor or designate. Failure to receive
      prior approval may result of the cancellation of your class.

      walls as possible to minimize the chance of damage to the canvas.

    %p

      shield/windbreak if available.

      be securely affixed to the edge of the table at all times, not
      hand-held or standing on the tabletop, and be pointed away
      from tent walls.
    %p
      All active heat sources must be supervised at all times.
    %p
      If your class involves glassmaking or working with hot glass
      or hot/melted metal, you must obtain prior approval of the
      University Chancellor or Registrar.  Without this approval,
      your class will not be scheduled.
    %p
      When working with hot glass, a heatproof surface must cover all
      tabletops to reduce the possibility of damage or fire.

      does not assume any responsibility for any classes not registered through
      it's official process. Any classes given by or through third parties or other
      entities are NOT part of the University.
    %p
      Every reasonable attempt to publish additions, deletions, and changes to the
      class list will be given, to the best of the Staff's abilities.
      These attempts may not be perfectly adequate in all cases, especially for
      last minute and on-site changes.
    %p
      In all cases, the definitive list and schedule of classes will be in Thing.
      The On-site books, scheduled at University Point in binders, and the
      Pennsic Independent are not authoritative. "Thing" is the authoritative
      and up to date resource.

      If your class includes a process that may produce sharp fragments,
      splinters, or shards (including but not limited to woodworking or
      metalworking), you must devise a way to collect any sharp fragments
      from the tent at the end of your class to avoid the possibility of

    Pennsic University Tent Weather Policy
  .col-7.policy-body
    %p
      Please do not unclip or undo the sides of the tent to open it up
      for airflow or allow students to do it.
    %p
      Pennsic University provides "brailing" ropes on the sides of each
      tent for use in raising the sides to allow airflow for hot weather.
      If your tent does not have adequate tie points to allow airflow,
      notify the University point and we will rectify the situation
    %p
      Pennsic Univeristy asks that you use the correct "slipped Half Hitch"
      (similar to a bridle hitch knot) to tie up the sides.
      If you are unfamiliar with the knot, we are happy to provide
      instruction on accomplishing it.
      We ask that you do not try to tie up the sides of the tent using
      any other knot or lines, or undo any lines to the posts that secure
      the tent to the ground.
    %p
      If you are unable to reach or do not know how to tie up the tent sides
      using these lines, notify University Point so we can address it.

      In the event of a sudden storm or high winds, it is necessary that the
      tent sides be dropped to the ground to prevent the tents from blowing out
      and tearing.
    %p
      The Teacher for the last class scheduled in any tent is responsible
      for dropping the sides of the tent and closing it up against weather.
      Please remember to see to this task when you are leaving.
