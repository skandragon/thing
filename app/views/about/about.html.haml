    %p
      This web site allows instructors to enter University classes
      to be taught through or in cooperation with the Pennsic University.
    %p
      It is entirely custom software, designed and implemented by a team
      of programmers, managed by Michael Graff, known
      in the Society for Creative Anachronism as Lord Griffin de Willingeham
      from the Great Barony of Namron, in the Stellar Kingdom of Ansteorra.
      Lord Griffin is also the primary developer.
      Please see the Credits section for a complete author list.
    %p
      The software is written in Ruby on Rails.  All the source is open
      and available on Github as
      = (link_to 'skandragon/thing', 'https://github.com/skandragon/thing', target: '_blank') + '.'
      If you are interested in contributing, please drop Michael a note
      through Github.

    %h3 Reporting Problems
    %p
      If you wish to report a defect in how the web site operates, such as
      errors on form submission, the best option is to
      = link_to 'open a ticket', 'https://github.com/skandragon/thing/issues'
      in our bug tracking system.  You will have to create a Github account
      if you do not already have one.
    %p
      If the problem is more administrative, such as scheduling issues,
      questions about how to use the system, or questions about University
      procedures, please use the Contact link near the bottom right of every
      page.  This will reach the Pennsic University staff via email.  You
      may also use this to report web site errors if you do not wish to use
      Github to report technical issues.

    %h3 Future Development
    %p
      While the initial focus is for Pennsic University classes and other
      Pennsic classes organized through the University, it could be made
      more generic to allow use at other events, both inside and outside
      the SCA.
