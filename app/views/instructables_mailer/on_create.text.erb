Greetings <%= @instructable.user.titled_sca_name %>,

Thank you for agreeing to submit a video class for Virtual Pennsic University 49 (Take 2) no later than July 20th.  Earlier submission of videos will be very much appreciated by the staff.  This timing allows us to allocate the necessary resources for the week before the start of the virtual university. The videos will be available in the Virtual Pennsic YouTube Channel from July 30 to September 6th, 2021.
The video we are expecting from you is:   <%= @instructable.name %>
We have a cover slide created specifically for this year’s Virtual Pennsic University that we would ask you to please include at the beginning of your video. It is located at
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YM-cTRJTax3J-FGClikr9fsGtSs1kjQ1/view?usp=sharing
It should be visible for 4 - 5 seconds. Also please include a slide with the class name and your name running for 4 - 5 seconds after that before the material begins.
Please be aware of copyright issues on shown material when you record your class and keep within the Fair Use guidelines. For more information see: Code of Best Practices for Fair Use in On-line videos https://cmsimpact.org/code/code-best-practices-fair-use-online-video/
Any teacher who wishes may put their email in the class description so students can contact them. If teachers prefer, as always, they can have students send a contact request to the universityregistrar@pennsicwar.org address and ask for it to be forwarded to the teacher. If teachers prefer to not have students contact them, that is also allowed.
To upload your video please go to:
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A6xQ-0cqPRfce4RGMIaHSXqLIy51vdns?usp=sharing
You must be signed into a google account to upload a video. You can either drag and drop the files onto the VPU Class Videos folder or use the “new” button in the upper left hand corner. One of the options is “upload a file”. Please name your file “XXX’s_YYY ” – where XXX is your SCA name, and YYY is the class name (limit of 50 characters). For example - Gwynnyd_BeginningSprang.mp4 - 23 characters - or Nigellas_How To Start A Fire Like A Moderately Int - 50 characters, no room to add “elligent Anglo-Saxon”. Please, no generic file names like “My class” or “Gwynnyd’s class”.
If you have handouts, they can be uploaded into the class handouts section of the google drive here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cWeKUHN2bdnTm8dmRxE7j3EnVNIn5n8s?usp=sharing
Since you registered your class on Thing, this already included giving us permission to upload the video onto YouTube. However, should you wish to have a separate form on file for your video, the form can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1atH6pPvQXqHZKR10VVJJlUQyxdZZi4YZ/view?usp=sharing
and can be returned to virtualpennsicuniversity@gmail.com
If you cannot upload your video, or have any other questions or concerns, please contact virtualpennsicuniversity@gmail.com and we will see what we can do.
During the time that Virtual Pennsic University will be available, notices of class updates and new class offerings will be distributed on several platforms, including Facebook pages for all SCA Kingdoms and various SCA artisan pages. We are getting excited to provide this year’s Virtual Pennsic University, and we hope you will join us!
Thank you so much for being a part of (Virtual) Pennsic University. Should you wish to submit additional videos, we will accept submissions through Thing until August 15th.
