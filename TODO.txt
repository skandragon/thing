2017 todo:

CSS / HTML work:

    TODO: change dl-horizontal CSS class to use .row and column sizing, as bootstrap 4 does not have dl-horizontal

    TODO: Make forms not look like crap.

    TODO: Make a list of all files which render HTML, and ensure they are using the proper classes.

    TODO: Consider moving away from simple_form, or make it entirely sane with Bootstrap.

    TODO: make required fields look like required fields.

    TODO: Make modals work.

    TODO: Make calendar date entry stuff work.

Coding work:

    TODO: Add click-accept pages for University requirements on the first class submission of the year.

    TODO: Make the various schedules distinct, with distinct locations.  If locations are shared, manage conflicts globally.

Older todo:


* Private camp locations, 2 per page, with lines to write on

* Class attendance count entry, pull-down for date and time, per location

* Filter classes displayed in track listing (for coordinators) and for
  users making a custom schdedule by date.

* Sort classes displayed in track listing and for users by date, rather than
  class name.

* Allow users to block out time they will NOT want to see any potential
  classes for.

* Allow track coordinators to create some sort of placeholder user, which
  can be used for scheduling.  Also, overridding instances per-instructor
  would be good. These classes might not count against the would-be
  user, and act more like "additional instructors" do now.

* Revamp the topic/culture listings we use.

* Email when a class is added to a user's "watch list" of topics.

* Email when a class is moved to a track, mailing both the winning and
  losing track coordinators.

* Email to instructors when instructor-visible changes occur to a class.

* Bug: database summary show classes which had N instances, but had some
  removed and the count lowered, as needing to be scheduled.  This is
  probably a flagging issue with the scheduled flag.

* Show duration, do not show end time, for users / instructors / etc.

* Don't use military time when possible.

* Allow admin to switch users (probably one direction only, into another
  non-admin user)

* On the free/busy list of rooms, clicking on a time and location should
  pop up a list of classes which are pending schedule for that track,
  with a search field for name and track.  Selecting a class from this
  list should populate an empty instance with that class.  If there are
  suddennly no free instances (someone else did it already) open up
  the normal scheduling page with a flash indicating what happened, and
  let the user fix it.

* Be more web 2.0, and use more ajax calls as appropriate.  Ideally, a
  javascript framework would be awesome.

* Per-instance user schedules
